                    <p>You have no idea what I've done for love. Just as you have no idea what you may one day do. Once long ago, a
                        girl named Favre sacrificed her wings for love. Thana, the young goddess she so willingly gave them up for,
                        sacrificed that same love for power. But everything has a cost.</p>
                    <p>Favre never got over the loss of her wings. And Thana's choices led to a life of eternal night, and later,
                        their destruction. Favre has bided her time ever since, waiting for the chance to resurrect the girl she
                        loves who turned her into the creature she hates.</p>
                    <p>Now, a thousand years later, Leyla, the crown princess of a vampire nation, must travel to Nekros, the island
                        of the dead, when her best friend is captured during an attack on her nation's capital. But nothing is as it
                        seems. The closer she gets to her goal, the more her body seems to work against her, and the more she risks
                        awakening an ancient evil and destroying everything she holds dear.</p>
                    <p>Set in the aftermath of a war between vampires, humans, and the gods that created them, Patrice Caldwell's
                        devastatingly romantic fantasy debut, Where Shadows Meet, enters the heart-wrenching pain of loss and the
                        struggle of self-discovery to ask: do we choose our fates, or do our fates choose us?</p>

                <div class="review-text">
                    <p>I was really excited for this book; however, it fell very flat for me. I love the LGBTQ+ rep and the concept of
                        the magical creatures that were tied in with the surrounding culture. I liked the plot and how it flowed.
                        However, I did not like the worldbuilding or the "lore." The beginning of the book is so much information all at
                        once; to call it an info dump would be putting it lightly. I appreciate the care that was put into each vampire
                        family, but it was TOO much. If the intent was to help with context when you start the book, it did not
                        accomplish that goal. I was more confused than I think I would have been without the pre history lesson. The
                        descriptions of the settings also left a lot to be desired. I could tell what the characters were doing, but I
                        had no idea of where they were or how the surroundings looked. I really wanted to like this book, but it wasn't
                        for me.</p>
